# CSC 365: Project 2
Made by Harley, Radhe, Seth, and Zayd 

Description:
The idea was to make a compiler that would read a txt file with HLC and then to have it translate to ASM and Machine code, the final output being a CSV file.
We were restricted to 4 registers, with 1kb of storage for data and instructions.
This is less of making a compiler and more of simulating one.
